			<h1>ðŸ‘‹ Hi, there!</h1>
			<p>
				I'm Nikki. I live near Seattle and work in tech; sometimes enabling technical teams, other times solutions selling, and <em>always</em> having fun. There are two things in life that fill my heart with joy: building meaningful relationships and eating really good bread.
			</p>
			<p>
				When I'm not training and empowering others, I can be found reading literature on mental health, cooking, staying active, and showing my husband where that thing is that he couldn't find.
			</p>
			<p>
				Welcome to my slice of the interweb, a cozy corner where tech musings mingle with hiking tales, kitchen experiments, and exploring what it means to be 'well'. Pull up a virtual chair, grab a (digital) cookie, and join the journey.
