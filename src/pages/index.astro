			<h1>ðŸ‘‹ Hi, there!</h1>
			<p>
				I'm Nikki. I live in Seattle and work in technical sales. I'm passionate about building meaningful relationships and bread.
			</p>
			<p>
				When I'm not selling dreams built on bits and bytes, I can be found reading literature on mental health, cooking, painting, climbing mountains, and showing my husband where that thing is that he couldn't find.
			</p>
			<p>
				Welcome to my online journal, a cozy corner where tech musings mingle with hiking tales, kitchen experiments, and exploring what it means to be 'well'. Pull up a virtual chair, grab a (digital) cookie, and join the journey.
