		A <a href="https://nownownow.com/about">"now page"</a> answers the question, "what's Nikki up to these days?" 
	</p>
	<h6>Living</h6>
		<p>I'm currently living in Issaquah, WA with Jonathan and our furry 3-year-old, Ume. We're surrounded by great friends and lots of nature. It's winter so it's cold and the days are shorter, which means I've fully given in to cozy life.</p>
	<h6>Doing</h6>
		<p>I've been spending each morning doing yoga, journaling, and reading. The journaling is specifically focused on gratitude. It's been a really peaceful way to start the day. </p>
	<h6>Watching</h6>
		<p>I started watching a new anime called Zom 100: Bucket List of the Dead. It's pretty timely for me as I've been pretty intentional about my career lately.</p>
	<h6>Planning</h6>
		<p>I've been thinking a lot about travel and looking forward to when Jonathan and I take our honeymoon to Italy later this year.</p>
	<h6>Learning</h6>
		<p>I've been refreshing my web development skills lately by building small projects in Next.js.</p>
	<h6>Reading</h6>
		<p>I'm reading a book about Mindfulness for Adult ADHD.</p>
	<h6>Working</h6>
		<p> I work for an amazing company X doing Y. </p>
