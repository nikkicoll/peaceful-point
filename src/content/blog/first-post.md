I canâ€™t even tell you the number of times Iâ€™ve designed a personal site, created and wrote out ideas to share, and then never followed through with any of it. Look at me now - I finally got over myself and just went for it.

Thanks for being here. I hope to write about cool things like what I learned during my ~2 year sabbatical, why focaccia is the ultimate carb, how to be nicer to yourself, how I learned to code, and which hikes are really hard and to avoid at all costs.

Really I just want a creative and fun corner of the internet that feels like mine and if you happen to enjoy it, thatâ€™s just extra icing on the cake. ðŸ™‚
